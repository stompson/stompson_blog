288,o14,1,g,30 nickel slide,shotgun trips,6.5,3.0,1.0,1.0,speed option,mccaffrey,run,5,"
de goes for pitch, correct keep. mayfield(+1) and onwenu(+1) pave the way; mtsu shaded a lb to this side and he’s free to hit after a decent gain. rps –1.

289,o9,2,g,30 nickel slide,shotgun 3-wide,7.5,3.0,1.0,1.0,arc zone keeper,mccaffrey,run,2,"
no widen from de, keep, mckeon(+0.5) cuts off a lb who has no angle. mccaffrey one on one with the lb in man on mckeon; he gets down to the 3 before fumbling(-3) out of bounds. refs(-1) mark this at the seven when it should be at the 5.

290,o7,3,g,4-4 over,shotgun 3te,9,1.0,1.0,3.0,arc zone keeper,mccaffrey,run,6,"
this is pa with a couple wrs in a route but as soon as mccaffrey pulls he’s running. all(-1) sees this and turns around to block a guy from the interior instead of the guy covering him, allowing that guy to stuff mccaffrey at the 1.

okay a keep is another easy walk-in td, mccaffrey(-2). it’s like they think it’s a trap, but it never is. mayfield(-2) doesn’t get much of a chip on a de and also misses a lb, who gets penetration. these two guys shoot to the backfield and are the reason charbonnet doesn’t grind in as the rest of the line (+0.5) moves the opponent into the endzone.

292,o15,1,10,nickel even,shotgun 3-wide,6,3.0,1.0,1.0,jet sweep,bell,run,6,"
finally a jet. this is a td if one guy doesn't make the tackle, he does. that’s the playside s. vansumeren moves out to block him; bell(-1) ends up making a rounded cut type substance that allows that guy to see the move and come inside bvs for the tackle. pressing the issue and then cutting abruptly is a td. rps +2

293,o9,2,4,okie zero,shotgun trips,7,4.0,1.0,0.0,speed option,turner,run,0,"
lb flies off edge; patterson(-1) immediately pitches and that guy can flow out to contain. fake pitch, td. mayfield(+1) sealed the edge well and got to the second level.

fade badly underthrown from patterson but db never looks and gets hit with one of those unfair but inevitable pis. (in, 0, protection 1/1)

another walk-in td if mccaffrey keeps. still could work but mayfield(-2) airballs on a lb who he really should id; he starts blocking a de that mckeon has and only comes off too late. that guy jumps on turner’s back as he tries to get back to the qb lane.

patterson(-1) fumbles the snap but manages to get it to vansumeren, no read possible. bvs(+1) gets a de in his face immediately with no motion and manages to plow the guy for two yards. impressive.
